Scaffold out a standard .gitignore for us, we'll be using pnpm and Typescript with Node.js 23 (via nvm). See @README.md for some additional deps. We will use Nuxt for the front-end and server. Ask me clarifying questions as needed.

# Movie Systems Design

## Pre-requisites

* An IDE or text editor of your choice
* [Sqlite3](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
* Environment: Choose either Python 3.x or TypeScript with Node.js (v18+). For Python, install necessary libraries as needed (e.g., sqlite3 (built-in), pandas, numpy, openai). For TypeScript, run npm init, install deps like sqlite3, @types/node, @openai/openai, and use ts-node or compile to JS for execution. Justify any additional choices (e.g., for embeddings or prompting chains) in your README.

## Overview

This assessment is designed for a Senior AI Engineer role and should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete. It focuses on testing your problem-solving skills, coding proficiency (in either Python or TypeScript with Node.js), data handling, SQL querying, and expertise in integrating and leveraging large language models (LLMs) for AI applications, with a strong emphasis on prompt engineering, LLM output generation, and evaluation. You&#39;ll work with a provided SQLite database containing movie-related data. The emphasis is on using LLMs to enrich data, generate outputs, and build intelligent systems through effective prompting.

## **The Databases**

* The databases are provided as a SQLite3 database in `db/`.  It does not require any credentials to login.  You can run SQL queries directly against the database using:

The movies table has the following columns:

* movieid: Unique identifier for each movie.
* title: Movie title.
* imdbid: IMDb identifier.
* overview: Brief description of the movie.
* productioncompanies: Pipe-separated list of production companies.
* releasedate: Release date of the movie.
* budget: Production budget in USD.
* revenue: Box office revenue in USD.
* runtime: Movie runtime in minutes.
* language: Primary language of the movie.
* genres: Pipe-separated list of genres (e.g., &#34;Action|Drama&#34;).
* status: Release status (e.g., &#34;Released&#34;).

## Tasks

#### Data Preparation &amp; data enrichment

For a sample of 50-100 movies, Use prompts to generate additional 5 additional attributes for the provided movies data.
Examples include:

* Sentiment analysis of movie overview (positive/negative/neutral).
* Categorize budget and revenue into tiers (e.g., low/medium/high) via LLM reasoning.
* Production Effectiveness Score using rating, budget, revenue

#### Movie System Design

Develop an LLM-integrated system for movie-related tasks (e.g., recommendations, rating predictions, or natural language querying)

* Design a system that leverages the prepared movie data and LLMs to generate outputs like personalized movie recommendations, user preference summaries, &amp; comparative analyses (e.g., comparing movies based on budget, revenue, or runtime).
* Demonstrate prompting techniques to generate specific structured outputs (e.g., provide 5-10 example ratings or movie details for prediction tasks). Test with varied inputs (e.g., &#34;Recommend action movies with high revenue and positive sentiment&#34; or &#34;Summarize preferences for user based on their ratings and movie overviews&#34;).

## Submission

We prefer you upload your project to GitHub and send us a link to your repo but you can also zip up the source and send it back to us.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
- **Examining Dependencies & Constraints** — I've checked the `README.md` and see SQLite databases in `db/movies.db` need to be accounted for in the `.gitignore`. My `.gitignore` scaffold will need to include these. I'm now considering how to best structure the file to ensure the appropriate exclusions.
- **Constructing the .gitignore** — I'm now implementing the `.gitignore`. I've added common exclusions for Node.js, pnpm, Nuxt, and TypeScript. Next, I'm integrating the SQLite exclusions, remembering to include the temporary file patterns to avoid tracking transient data. I am adding a comment to clarify the intention of these exclusions. Then, I will add the OS-specific file exclusions.

_**Agent (gemini-3-flash-preview 2026-02-03 18:42:21Z)**_

I will create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file tailored for a Nuxt, pnpm, and TypeScript project, including patterns for Node.js 23 and SQLite temporary files.
