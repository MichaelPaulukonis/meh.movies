- **Understanding the Challenge Now** — I've just started with the project. Right now, I'm focusing on the first step, going through the `README.md` file. I need to get a clear picture of what's expected of me to make sure I am on the right track from the start.

# Movie Systems Design

## Pre-requisites

* An IDE or text editor of your choice
* [Sqlite3](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
* Environment: Choose either Python 3.x or TypeScript with Node.js (v18+). For Python, install necessary libraries as needed (e.g., sqlite3 (built-in), pandas, numpy, openai). For TypeScript, run npm init, install deps like sqlite3, @types/node, @openai/openai, and use ts-node or compile to JS for execution. Justify any additional choices (e.g., for embeddings or prompting chains) in your README.

## Overview

This assessment is designed for a Senior AI Engineer role and should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete. It focuses on testing your problem-solving skills, coding proficiency (in either Python or TypeScript with Node.js), data handling, SQL querying, and expertise in integrating and leveraging large language models (LLMs) for AI applications, with a strong emphasis on prompt engineering, LLM output generation, and evaluation. You'll work with a provided SQLite database containing movie-related data. The emphasis is on using LLMs to enrich data, generate outputs, and build intelligent systems through effective prompting.

## **The Databases**

* The databases are provided as a SQLite3 database in `db/`.  It does not require any credentials to login.  You can run SQL queries directly against the database using:

The movies table has the following columns:

* movieid: Unique identifier for each movie.
* title: Movie title.
* imdbid: IMDb identifier.
* overview: Brief description of the movie.
* productioncompanies: Pipe-separated list of production companies.
* releasedate: Release date of the movie.
* budget: Production budget in USD.
* revenue: Box office revenue in USD.
* runtime: Movie runtime in minutes.
* language: Primary language of the movie.
* genres: Pipe-separated list of genres (e.g., "Action|Drama").
* status: Release status (e.g., "Released").

## Tasks

#### Data Preparation & data enrichment

For a sample of 50-100 movies, Use prompts to generate additional 5 additional attributes for the provided movies data.
Examples include:

* Sentiment analysis of movie overview (positive/negative/neutral).
* Categorize budget and revenue into tiers (e.g., low/medium/high) via LLM reasoning.
* Production Effectiveness Score using rating, budget, revenue

#### Movie System Design

Develop an LLM-integrated system for movie-related tasks (e.g., recommendations, rating predictions, or natural language querying)

* Design a system that leverages the prepared movie data and LLMs to generate outputs like personalized movie recommendations, user preference summaries, & comparative analyses (e.g., comparing movies based on budget, revenue, or runtime).
* Demonstrate prompting techniques to generate specific structured outputs (e.g., provide 5-10 example ratings or movie details for prediction tasks). Test with varied inputs (e.g., "Recommend action movies with high revenue and positive sentiment" or "Summarize preferences for user based on their ratings and movie overviews").

## Submission

We prefer you upload your project to GitHub and send us a link to your repo but you can also zip up the source and send it back to us.

I will start by reading the `README.md` to understand the project requirements.

- **Deciding the Approach** — I'm focused on the practicalities now. Considering the data enrichment phase, I'll need to define clear prompts for the LLM to create those extra movie attributes. Then, I have to figure out how to best integrate the LLM into a movie-related system. This could involve several different avenues.
- **Examining the Data** — I'm digging into the database schema now, taking a close look at the existing movie data. The initial assessment is crucial to figuring out what the LLM can realistically enrich. I'll need to understand the data types and the quality of the current information. Next, I plan to select the target movies.

I will explore the database to understand its structure and sample the data.
