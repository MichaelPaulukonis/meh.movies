# Project Overview & Architectural Trade-offs: meh.movies 🙄

**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Context:** Presentation / Q&A Reference Material  
**Author:** Gemini CLI Agent (based on developer input)

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Vibe-First" Discovery

The fundamental architectural decision was to shift from **Deterministic Search** (Genre/Year) to **Semantic Discovery** (Mood/Vibe). This was achieved using an **Offline Enrichment / Online Inference** pattern.

* **Decision:** Pre-enriching the database using Claude 3.5 Haiku.
* **Trade-off:** We traded **Real-time Accuracy** for **Runtime Performance**. By "pre-baking" Gen-Z tags and vibes into SQLite, the runtime engine doesn't need to analyze plot summaries on the fly; it simply matches user moods to pre-calculated thematic markers.

## 2. Tech Stack: The "Road Not Taken"

| Technology | The Choice (The "Why") | The Trade-off (The "Why Not") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nuxt 3 (SSR)** | Chosen for "Zero-Config" SSR and the Nitro server engine. Provides a cohesive full-stack environment for rapid prototyping. | **Why not React/Next?** While industry-standard, Nuxt (Vue) offers a flatter learning curve for this specific project and cleaner template/logic separation. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Chosen for **Development Speed**. Utility classes allow for rapid iteration of a "high-energy" UI without context-switching to CSS files. | **The Cost:** Loss of **Semantic Clarity**. Without a design system layer, theme-switching became a "utility soup" grep task. V2 would require custom theme mapping in `tailwind.config.ts`. |
| **SQLite** | Chosen for **Portability**. The entire database is a single portable file (`movies.db`). | **Why not Postgres + Vector?** Avoided the "Vector DB Tax" (infra cost/complexity). We used "Small-Scale RAG" (sampling) instead of global vector search to prove the POC. |
| **Claude 3.5 (Anthropic)** | Chosen for **Persona Quality**. Sonnet 3.5 provides a more natural, less "robotic" playful tone compared to GPT-4o, which is critical for the Gen-Z branding. | **Why not OpenAI?** OpenAI is often faster/cheaper, but Claude’s steering via System Prompts proved more reliable for maintaining the "Oracle" persona. |

## 3. Implicit Trade-offs (Hidden Decisions)

### Stochastic vs. Precise Search

* **Current:** The engine samples 20 movies and asks the LLM to pick the best match.

* **Trade-off:** We prioritize **Diversity** (users see different things every time) over **Precision** (mathematically "best" result). This prevents the "recommendation bubble" common in traditional algorithms.

### Tiered LLM Strategy

* **Background (Haiku):** Cheap/Fast for bulk enrichment of thousands of records.

* **Frontend (Sonnet):** High-intelligence for nuanced user interaction.
* **Outcome:** Optimized cost-performance ratio (approx. $0.0004 per movie enriched).

### Security vs. Friction

* **Approach:** Basic string sanitization and strict System Role guardrails.

* **Trade-off:** We kept the UX frictionless (no auth/heavy filtering) at the cost of vulnerability to sophisticated prompt injections.

## 4. Technical Debt & Evolution

### The "Tailwind Vernacular" Problem

The project relies heavily on raw utility classes. A major piece of tech debt is the lack of **Semantic Tokens**.

* *Lesson learned:* Tailwind is excellent for a POC, but for a multi-theme production app, defining a vernacular (e.g., `text-brand-primary` instead of `text-purple-500`) is mandatory to avoid maintenance friction.

### Vendor Neutrality

Post-MVP, we are migrating to **OpenRouter**.

* **Reasoning:** To prevent vendor lock-in and enable A/B testing of newer models (e.g., Llama 3 or DeepSeek) against the current Claude-based benchmark.

## 5. Summary Conclusion

"The stack was selected to maximize **Developer Velocity** and **Output Quality**. While we accepted intentional debt in CSS structure and search precision, the result is a functional prototype that successfully transforms 'Database Queries' into 'Vibe Checks'."
