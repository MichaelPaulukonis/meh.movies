I need help generating code for my project. Create well-structured, production-ready code that follows best practices.

## Code Generation Request

- **What to generate**: Website for `meh.movies`
- **Technology stack**: Nuxt, Sqlite, Typescript
- **Functionality**: 
- **Requirements**: [Any specific requirements or constraints]

## Context

- **Project type**: Web App
- **Dependencies**: Nuxt, Sqlite, Typescript, Anthropic API
- **Style preferences**: TypeScript
- **Web Design**: initial implementation with be a simple black-on-white design (think "generic") with a dark-mode toggle to white-on-black. 

## Code Generation Guidelines

Please generate code that includes:

### 1. Complete Implementation

- Full, working code that can be used immediately
- All necessary imports and dependencies
- Proper error handling where appropriate
- Type definitions (TypeScript/Python type hints)

### 2. Best Practices

- Follow language and framework conventions
- Use proper naming conventions
- Include appropriate comments and documentation
- Implement security best practices
- Optimize for performance where relevant

### 3. Code Structure

- Organize code logically with clear separation of concerns
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Make code modular and reusable
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable

### 4. Additional Features

- Include proper validation and error handling
- Add logging where appropriate
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Make code testable and maintainable

### 5. Documentation

- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Include JSDoc/docstrings for functions and classes
- Provide usage examples
- Explain any complex algorithms or patterns

## Specific Requests

Based on what I'm generating, please also provide:

### For Components (React/Vue/Angular)

- Props/data interface definitions
- Event handlers and lifecycle methods
- Styling structure (CSS classes, styled-components, etc.)
- Accessibility considerations
- Usage examples

### for API Endpoints

- Request/response schemas
- Input validation
- Error handling and status codes
- Authentication/authorization if needed
- Documentation/OpenAPI specs

### For Functions/Classes

- Input/output type definitions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Unit test examples
- Performance considerations
- Usage documentation

### For Database/ORM Code

- Schema definitions
- Query optimizations
- Data validation
- Connection management

## Additional Considerations

- Make the code production-ready BUT NOT ENTERPRISEY - this is for a small demo project
- Include security considerations
- Optimize for maintainability
- Consider scalability implications

Ask clarifying questions if you need more specific details about the requirements or context.
